## Features

On call, chad by default strides across your screen once and exits. However, his activity can be changed
by the following flags:

* -c [r|g|b|m|c|y]: Change chad's color & enable color changing via keyboard input while running.

* -a SLEEP_TIME: Adjust sleep rate (in nanoseconds). Small number == faster chad

* -f: Chad ignores signals

* -b SIZE: Increase spacing of chad by SIZE

* -l: infinite looping

* -s: Chad stays in the center, striding in place.
